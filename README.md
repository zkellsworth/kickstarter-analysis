# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.

Using this chart we can see that out of multiple entertainement and arts Kickstarter campains that theater and music take the lions share of number of campains in raw count with theater campains coming out on top. This does suggest that looking to fund your project through kickstarter is a good way to go as Kickstarter seems to be a gathering place for people interested in these projects.

## Most successful campaigns were in the summer

I'll leave the reasoning out of it, but the data shows that more campains were successfull when launched during the summer months.

## Goal Amounts

Finally lets draw attention to the specified goal amounts. We'll see that the average of most succesfful campains were right around the $4000 mark. While there was an outlier well above that at $15,000 the majority of campaigns stayed around that $4000 point. Likewise when asking for pledges the average pledge was $1000 with very few going above that amount.
